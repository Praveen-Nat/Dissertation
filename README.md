This repository contains the code and resources developed for a research project focused on the detection and segmentation of water hyacinth, an invasive aquatic plant, using Sentinel-2 satellite data and advanced deep learning techniques. The project aims to provide an efficient and scalable solution for monitoring and managing water hyacinth spread, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.
